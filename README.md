# Pokemon Game Bot

The Pokemon Game Bot is a Telegram bot that allows users to play a Pokemon-themed game directly in the Telegram chat. It provides an interactive and engaging experience for Pokemon fans, allowing them to catch and train virtual Pokemon, battle against other players, and explore various in-game features.

## Features

- **Catch and Train Pokemon**: Users can catch virtual Pokemon by participating in battles, completing quests, or exploring different locations within the game. They can then train their Pokemon to make them stronger and evolve them into more powerful forms.

- **Battle System**: Engage in exciting battles with other players and AI trainers. Use strategic moves, abilities, and items to defeat opponents and earn rewards.

- **In-Game Economy**: The game features an in-game economy where users can earn and spend virtual currency to purchase items, equipment, and Pokemon-related resources.

## Working on That Features

- **Quests and Challenges**: Embark on quests and challenges to earn experience points, items, and rare Pokemon. Complete tasks and overcome obstacles to progress in the game.

- **Leaderboards and Rankings**: Compete with other players and climb the leaderboards. Gain recognition for your skills, achievements, and collection of powerful Pokemon.

## Technologies Used

- **Telegram Bot API**: The bot is built using the Telegram Bot API, which provides the necessary tools and interfaces to interact with Telegram users and handle commands, messages, and updates.

- **Node.js**: The backend of the bot is developed using Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime environment, allowing for efficient and scalable server-side programming.

- **MongoDB**: The game data, including user profiles, Pokemon information, and game progress, is stored and managed using MongoDB, a NoSQL database system.

- **Mongoose**: Mongoose is used as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, providing a straightforward and schema-based solution for interacting with the database.
